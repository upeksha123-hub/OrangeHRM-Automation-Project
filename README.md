# OrangeHRM-Automation-Project

Tools & Technologies:

Project Description:

Developed automated test scripts for the OrangeHRM demo site using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

Implemented the Page Object Model to organize locators and actions for login and logout functionalities, ensuring better code maintainability and reusability.

Automated login with valid credentials and verified navigation to the dashboard by printing the current URL.

Implemented logout automation by interacting with the user profile dropdown and logout button.

Managed browser setup and teardown using TestNG annotations to maintain a clean test environment.

Used explicit waits and Thread.sleep where necessary to stabilize the tests.
